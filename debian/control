Description: Biometric Authentication Service
 The service layer of the biometric identification authentication framework.
 The service layer uses the DBus bus to provide the upper application with
 operation interfaces such as feature enroll, feature verify, feature identify,
 feature search, feature delete, etc. Meanwhile, it also provides notification
 of device status changes event and notification of USB device hotplug event.
 .
 This package contains a library for biometric authentication.

Package: libbiometric0
Architecture: any
Section: libs
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends},
         ${misc:Depends},
         systemd,
Provides: ${bio-drv-api:Provides}
Description: Biometric Identification library
 The core layer of biometric identification authentication framework.
 The core layer abstracts the common operation of all kinds of biometric
 recognition, constructs the underlying framework of biometric recognition,
 and provides the general function and unified data storage method.
 .
 This package contains a library for biometric identification.

         systemd,
Description: Biometric Identification DRIVER API - development files
 It provides the development file for driver development based on biometric
 identification authentication framework.
 .
 This package contains the development files (headers, static libraries)

Description: Biometric authentication utils
 Biometric authentication tools.
 This package provides the biometric-config-tool and biometric-device-discover
 tools:
  - biometric-auth-client: The command line client of the biometric
    identification framework service;
  - biometric-config-tool: add, remove, configure the biometric drivers;
  - biometric-device-discover: discover the devices supported by the biometric
    framework;
